############################# Notes on My Code ##########################

I used dictionaries to get the information and you'll see my C++ background
popping up and my attempts to become more Pythonic.

I got the job done but I still have questions on how I could improve this source
code. Could I run it in small batches so that a database could load some dataset
and not stall?
Could I add a feature where there were update options? I feel like this code is
pretty static and I see where it needs to be more flexible, but I don't have
the coding chomps for that yet.

I don't have any fancy "main" functions with __initi__. I'm a pretty solid
pandas person, so no pandas is a sad day for me.

I also am not strong on unit-testing. I tested my code A LOT using print
functions: doubling check type, and length of things. And then deleted it as
it was clutter.

I have a few "try" and "excepts", but overall,
I know have ways to do to build in asserts/assertions and I am interested
in learning more about how to do that. I think it's counter-intuitive for me
to create desired output when I have data to organize. I take a discovery
approach and that mindset probably needs to be worked on for large datasets.

Thanks for letting me participate in the coding challenge. I would love to be a
fellow and am so excited by the prospect. I have a lot to learn and I am ready
to rise to the challenges before me.

All the best,
Sarah
